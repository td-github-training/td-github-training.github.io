# What is Git?

Git is a popular version control system used for both open source and commercial software development.

Git has the following unique features:

- **Distributed**: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git gives every developer a local copy of the entire project history. This means you can create commmits locally on your machine without needing a connection to the remote, and then sync or push changes when you reconnect.

- **Advanced Branching and Merging**: Git's branching model is extremely lightweight and fast, making it easy to experiment with different development paths.

- **Rebasing and Cherry-Picking**: With Git's advanced features like rebase and cherry-pick, you can alter commit history for a cleaner, linear project history, or pick specific commits to apply to another branch.

### Git Saves Snapshots

Unlike most other version control systems, git does not store your information as a series of changes, or _deltas_:

Instead, Git takes a **snapshot** of your _entire_ repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a **commit**.
