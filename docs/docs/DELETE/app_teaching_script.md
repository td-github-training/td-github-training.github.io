# GitHub training scripts

We use [scripts](https://github.com/githubtraining/training-manual/tree/main/script) to set up repositories with these class activities. They're located in the same repository as this [training manual](https://github.com/githubtraining/training-manual), inside `/script`.

## Prerequisites

- Note that these scripts are meant to interact with an organization on GitHub.com
- If you're using GitHub Enterprise Server, and access to GitHub.com is limited within your organization, import the following repos and all their branches to your GitHub organization (you'll need access to GitHub.com to perform this one-time operation):
  - [caption-this](https://github.com/githubtraining/caption-this)
  - [conflict-practice](https://github.com/githubtraining/conflict-practice)
  - [github-games](https://github.com/githubtraining/github-games)

## Clone the repository

- Clone the [training manual](https://github.com/githubtraining/training-manual) repo to your local machine

## Documentation

- Follow the directions for setup and use located in the `/script` [`README.md`](https://github.com/githubtraining/training-manual/tree/main/script#readme) file
